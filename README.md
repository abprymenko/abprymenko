Q)What can you do to ensure that each message is only processed once,
so that your customer is not spammed with 2 or more welcome emails?
A)Both RabbitMq and Kafka process messages once a priori. That is, you don't need to do anything additional.
But in order to understand the status of the message, after sending the message, 
you need to update its status in the database
